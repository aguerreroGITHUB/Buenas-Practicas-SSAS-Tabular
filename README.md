# Best Practices to Develop a Tabular Cube

Developing an efficient and maintainable tabular cube requires following certain best practices that ensure both performance and ease of model management. Below are some key recommendations:

## 1. Use Views for Data Extraction
It is always preferable to read data from views rather than direct tables. This allows any filter modifications in production to be handled by an `ALTER VIEW` script rather than requiring a full deployment of the tabular model. This approach improves flexibility and reduces future downtime.

## 2. Filtering Data in Views for Generic Dimensions
When working with dimensions that are applicable to several datamarts, filter the data in the views by crossing them with the corresponding facts. This significantly reduces the volume of data transferred, optimizing model performance and efficiency.

## 3. Create Relationships from the Fact Table to Dimensions
Establishing relationships always from the fact table to the dimensions helps to maintain a clearer and more organized structure in the model. This also makes it easier to understand the data flow and dependencies between tables.

## 4. Simplify Measures with the CALCULATE Pattern
Most measures can be solved using the pattern:
```DAX
Measure := CALCULATE(Aggregate, Filter1, Filter2, Filter3, ...)
```

This approach simplifies the creation of measures and makes the code easier to read and maintain.

## 5. Organize Division Formulas with VAR
When creating measures involving divisions, organize the formula as follows:

```DAX
Measure := 
VAR Numerator = CALCULATE(Numerator)
VAR Denominator = CALCULATE(Denominator)
RETURN DIVIDE(Numerator, Denominator, 0)
```

This method facilitates the reuse of similar formulas by copying and pasting, and improves the readability and maintainability of DAX code.

## 6. Use Tabular Editor to Duplicate Tables
Visual Studio does not allow duplicating existing tables with their hierarchies, visibility and folders. To overcome this limitation, use Tabular Editor. In addition, in Visual Studio you cannot create calculation groups, another functionality that Tabular Editor supports and that can improve the organization of measurements in the model.

## 7. Validate Data with Direct Queries
Always validate the data generated by the tabular cube measures by direct queries to your Data Warehouse (DWC). Make sure that the results match the direct queries to the database, thus ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Implementing these practices not only improves the performance of the tabular cube, but also facilitates its maintenance and scalability, ensuring that the data presented is accurate and consistent.
